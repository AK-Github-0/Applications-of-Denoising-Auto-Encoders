# Applications-of-DAE

This repository consists of different applications of Denoising Autoencoders(DAEs).

Overall, DAEs are a powerful tool for various applications that involve noisy or high-dimensional data, and they can help extract meaningful features from the data that can be used for downstream tasks. Denoising Autoencoders (DAEs) have a wide range of applications beyond . Here are some examples:

Dynamic Feature Acquisition: DAEs can be used for dynamic feature selection effectively as mentioned in M. Kachuee, S. Darabi, B. Moatamed and M. Sarrafzadeh, "Dynamic Feature Acquisition Using Denoising Autoencoders," in IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, vol. 30, no. 8, pp. 2252-2262, Aug. 2019, doi: 10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2880403.

Anomaly detection: DAEs can be used for anomaly detection in datasets by training on normal data and identifying deviations from the learned normal pattern.

Dimensionality reduction: DAEs can be used for dimensionality reduction, where the encoder layer learns a compressed representation of the input data that can be used for downstream tasks such as classification or clustering.

Image deblurring and denoising: DAEs can be trained to remove noise or blur from images by learning to reconstruct the original image from the noisy or blurred version.

Data augmentation: DAEs can be used for data augmentation by generating new, realistic samples from existing data by adding noise to the original data and training the DAE to denoise it.

Speech and audio processing: DAEs can be used for speech and audio processing tasks such as speech recognition, speaker recognition, and music genre classification by training on spectrograms or other representations of the audio data.

Natural language processing: DAEs can be used for natural language processing tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and language modeling by training on word embeddings or other text representations.

I will try to add codes of all applications of DAEs in this repository.
